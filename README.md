Nuclear Impact Model – Classical and Quantum-Enhanced Simulation
The Jupyter Notebook india_Vs_pakistanWar(Predicted_Sims).ipynb presents a data-driven simulation model that analyzes the environmental, economic, and societal impacts of hypothetical nuclear events using synthetic data. Developed by MD. MARUF MULLAH, this project includes both classical and quantum-inspired computing approaches to simulate post-conflict global impact metrics such as GDP loss, famine risk, soot-induced climate change, and human life loss.

This notebook uses synthetic data for educational and analytical purposes only. The title is illustrative and does not reflect real-world events, predictions, or geopolitical scenarios.

Purpose
The model demonstrates data analysis techniques for exploring complex global scenarios using both classical simulation and quantum-inspired uncertainty modeling. It is intended for academic and research purposes with synthetic data.

Dataset
The synthetic dataset includes the following variables:

nukes_used: Number of nuclear devices used

avg_yield_kt: Average yield in kilotons

target_city_population: Population per target city

urbanization_level: Percentage of urban population

soot_emission_Tg: Estimated soot emission (in Teragrams)

human_lives_lost_millions: Estimated lives lost in millions

gdp_impact_pct: Estimated GDP impact percentage

expected_global_temp_drop_C: Estimated drop in global temperature in Celsius

estimated_famine_risk_millions: Estimated number of people at risk of famine

Quantum Computing Integration
The notebook includes an additional section where quantum-inspired simulation is used to introduce probabilistic uncertainty into key outcome variables such as soot emission, temperature drop, and famine risk. This quantum-enhanced portion uses statistical modeling techniques that simulate quantum uncertainty for richer simulations and comparison with classical approaches.
