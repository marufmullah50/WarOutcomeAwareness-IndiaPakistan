Nuclear Impact Model
Notebook
The Jupyter Notebook india_Vs_pakistanWar(Predicted_Sims).ipynb contains a data-driven model that simulates the environmental, economic, and societal impacts of hypothetical nuclear events using synthetic data. Developed by MD. MARUF MULLAH, the model analyzes key variables such as soot emissions, GDP impact, and famine risk to demonstrate data analysis techniques. The notebook includes code, synthetic datasets, and optional visualizations (e.g., plots of impact metrics). It is intended for academic and analytical purposes only, with the notebook’s name used for illustrative purposes and not reflecting real-world scenarios.
Purpose
The model showcases data analysis techniques for studying complex global scenarios, intended for educational and analytical use with synthetic data.
Dataset
The synthetic dataset in the notebook includes variables like:

nukes_used: Number of nuclear devices.
avg_yield_kt: Average yield in kilotons.
soot_emission_Tg: Soot emissions in teragrams.
human_lives_lost_millions: Estimated lives lost.
gdp_impact_pct: Percentage impact on GDP.
estimated_famine_risk_millions: Population at risk of famine.

Requirements
